# About Carob

The carob project is part of the [reagro](https://reagro.org/index.html) "family" of projects that aim to support efforts to improve data driven agricultural production
and providing tools (and in the carob case data) to agricultural practitioners, data scientists and the general public.
In particular, Carob provides a standardized and formatted dataset dollections for applications related to a variety of agricultural processes
that can be leveraged to improve agricultural production.

It does so by providing users a workflow to indicate how a dataset is brought into a common format.
This workflow provides a variety of functions contained in the [`carobiner`](carobiner.html) package to facilitate the standardization.

Carob works as a community build project, so any dataset processed by a contributor is added to the pool of scripts that
any user interested can benefit from and compile their own version of carob. This page also offers the possibility of
compiling the datasets provided by the different contributors [here]().
